Technologies Used
Javascript
HTML

AJAX
Custom API
Postman


Approach Taken
we started by implementing a simple login feature. Then we implemented a way to post and comment under each post. Once we had that set we made it so that the user was able to delete his/her comments. we also gave the user the option to go to his/her profile and view his/her posts there.


How to Use
You start at the login/registration page and enter your username and password if you are a returning user or you fill out the registration info to create a new user. Once the user is created you can login. Once you login you get redirected to the home page where all the comments are.


Unsolved problems
The delete post feature was down in the API. We were unable to implement that feature.
