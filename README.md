# officey
Reddit-like app but for offices!

BRIEF DESCRIPTION:
This project is a rough clone of the popular message boards media site, Reddit. The user will have the ability to create a new account, update that account, post and comment on posts.

Technologies Used
Javascript
HTML
CSS
Postman

https://ipinfo.io/ to log users general location

Approach Taken
I started by implementing a simple two database system. One for users, and one for the friendship connections between the users. Once I had those set and arranged I moved into hashing the passwords and adding a salt to make things secure. I gave users the option to write on their friends profile page / comment on their own.


How to Use
You start at the index page and either enter your name and password if you are a returning user or you click the register button where you are taken to a registration page to fill out the required information.


Unsolved problems
Improve the homepage so that you see the newest posts at the top and/or the posts with the most likes
Add time posted to posts
Add date and time that the user created their profile
